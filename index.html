    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
      Serious Sans is a legible monospaced font made to resemble the classic
      Comic Sans font we all know and love. It is designed to be suitable for
      use in a professional coding environment while retaining the playfulness
      of the original
    </p>

        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://github.com/kaBeech/serious-sans/blob/main/vscExample.png"
        ><img

          title="Serious Sans in VS Code"
          style="max-width: 100%"
      /></a>
    </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      To overcome writer's block, some writers change the font of their word
      processor to Comic Sans. Perhaps the jaunty style helps put our brains in
      a playful mood so we can just write without getting hung up in
      self-criticism
    </p>
    <p>
      Serious Sans aims to provide that same experience for programmers and
      their IDE's. As coders, we also enjoy playful styling and tools that help
      us just get to work. But most of us like to have certain standards that
      make our work easier. Monospacing and legibility are important factors
      that facilitate quick scanning of many lines of code
    </p>

    <h3>Legibility</h3>
    <p>
      Legibility means being able to quickly tell which character is which. In
      fonts with low legibility, for example, it can be difficult to tell the
      difference between an upper case 'I' and a numeral '1'
    </p>

    <h3>Monospacing</h3>
    <p>
      Monospacing means ensuring every character has the same width. This is
      helpful to quickly line up rows of text. For an example of why this is
      helpful, consider adding up a fancy dinner bill:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://github.com/kaBeech/serious-sans/blob/main/fancyDinner.png"
        ><img
          src="https://github.com/kaBeech/serious-sans/raw/main/fancyDinner.png"
          alt="Adding up a fancy dinner bill"
          title="Adding up a fancy dinner bill"
          style="max-width: 100%"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a monospaced font, getting all those numbers to line up for easy
      adding would be a pain!
    </p>

    <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>
      I originally changed the font in my IDE to Comic Mono as a joke. I decided
      to leave it that way for a while for fun, and found that it actually seems
      to help my mindset while working. I made Serious Sans as my own leetle
      fork to improve the usability of the font ^_^
    </p>

    <h2>Differences from Comic Mono</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>I edited the 'a' to make it look less like an 'o'</li>
      <li>
        I remade the Bold weight style and added a Light weight style as well
      </li>
      <li>I added Italic styles for each weight style</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>
      Note: you can ignore the generate.py file - it generates the original
      Comic Mono font. I haven't decided yet if I'm going to modify or remove it
    </p>

    <h2>Any issues?</h2>
    <p>If you notice any, please feel free to open an issue!</p>
    <p>
      Please note that so far I have only been using the original
      SeriousSans.tff. The other styles have been reviewed but are largely
      untested
