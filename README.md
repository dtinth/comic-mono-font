# Serious Sans
A legible monospace font for playful professionals. Comic Sans for hackers

This font is a fork of [dtinth](https://github.com/dtinth)’s [Comic Mono](https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font), which in turn is a fork of [Shannon Miwa](https://github.com/shannpersand)’s [Comic Shanns](https://github.com/shannpersand/comic-shanns) (version 1)

## What?
Serious Sans is a legible monospaced font made to resemble the classic Comic Sans font we all know and love. It is designed to be suitable for use in a professional coding environment while retaining the playfulness of the original

**If you'd like to enter your own example text and preview all six styles, [check out the Serious Sans webpage](https://kaBeech.github.io/serious-sans)**

Here's what it looks like viewing one of [my Advent Of Code functions](https://kaBeech.github.io/Advent-Of-Code-2022) in VS Code:

## Why?
To help overcome writer's block, some writers change the font of their word processor to Comic Sans. Perhaps the jaunty style helps put our brains in a playful mood so we can just write without getting hung up in self-criticism

Serious Sans aims to provide that same experience for programmers and their IDE's. As coders, we also enjoy playful styling and tools that help us just get to work. But most of us like to have certain standards that make our work easier. Monospacing and legibility are important factors that facilitate quick scanning of many lines of code

### Legibility
Legibility means being able to quickly tell which character is which. In fonts with low legibility, for example, it can be difficult to tell the difference between an upper case 'I' and a numeral '1'

### Monospacing
Monospacing means ensuring every character has the same width. This is helpful to quickly line up rows of text. For an example of why this is helpful, consider adding up a fancy dinner bill:

Without a monospaced font, getting all those numbers to line up for easy adding would be a pain!

### Origins
I originally changed the font in my IDE to Comic Mono as a joke. I decided to leave it that way for a while for fun, and found that it actually seems to help my mindset while working. I made Serious Sans as my own leetle fork to improve the usability of the font ^_^

## Differences from Comic Mono
1. I edited the 'a' to make it look less like an 'o'
2. I remade the Bold weight style and added a Light weight style as well
3. I added Italic styles for each weight style
4. I added OpenType format versions

## Any issues?
If you notice any, please feel free to open an issue!

The Light weight version could use some refining still (the height
and x-height seem to be off for some glyphs). I improved the x-height
for the Light Italic style (where it was especially noticable) but I
have not yet improved Light Original

There are some horizontal alignment issues with t/T's and f/F's in the Italic styles

Please note that so far I have only been using the original SeriousSans.tff. The other styles have been reviewed but are largely untested
